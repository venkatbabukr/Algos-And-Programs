## Algorithms

### Simple Array Iteration
1. Is Palindrome (String scan using 2 pointers - left & right)
2. Is Panagram (String scan with map the characters to boolean exists)
3. First non-repeating character (Single scan with Map lookup)
4. Maximum vowels containing substring (Window scan)
5. Longest non-repeating substring
    * First non-repeating (Window scan with updating longestStart & end)
    * All non-repeating
6. Isomorphic strings
    * isIsomorphic of 2 strings (Single scan with building the isomorphic character map)
    * getIsomorphic mapping (Single scan with building the isomorphic character map)
7. Anagram strings
    * Approach #1: Single scan with construction of character count map
    * Approach #2: Sort characters in string and compare
8. Are k Anagrams
9. Group anagram words (Java 8 - Collect/Map words by their char count maps)
10. KMP Pattern matching (Knuth-Morris-Pratt)
11. Inline reverse string by word (Two scans - reverse string and reverse individual words)

### Dynamic programming
12. Longest common substring
13. Longest common subsequence

## Test-Cases to be tested
1. Edge cases
    * Null
    * Empty strings
2. Repeating patterns of characters
3. Case sensitivity
4. Lexicographic ordering
5. Character set & Internationalization
6. Interchanging of string arguments (Ex: In whether two strings are isomorphic or not)

## Approaches
1. Sliding Window
2. Two Pointers
3. Fast and Slow Pointers
4. Merge Intervals
5. Cyclic Sort
6. Top K elements that can help you to solve zones of frequently asked coding problems.
